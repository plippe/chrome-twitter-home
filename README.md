Twitter's {searchTerms}
===================

Visiting Twitter with Google Chrome can be a pain. 
Twitter's "{searchTerms}" page is often displayed when you just want to get to its home page. 
If you find it annoying too, just install this little Chrome extension. 
With it, when the "{searchTerms}" page should be displayed, the home page is displayed instead.

The fastest way to install it is by visiting Google Chrome's extensions store:
